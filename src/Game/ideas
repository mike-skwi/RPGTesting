Environment:
>> maybe make the environment affect how weapons are used and what kind of attacks you can use?
       >> ie: fire magic wont work too well in a damp cave, but it would provide light
       >> lighting should also be important in caves and what not. Add a bonus miss chance in envis were lighting is low


Character:
    >> maybe have a group of people/party. I feel like the AI should do most of the work and you can only control one person/
       >> but I am not confident in my ability to make an AI yet lol
